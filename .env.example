# Vercel KV Configuration
# This is automatically configured when you create a KV database in Vercel
# No manual setup required!

# The app works in two modes:
# 1. Demo Mode (No configuration): Data stored temporarily in memory
# 2. Production Mode (With Vercel KV): Data persisted in Redis

# To enable Production Mode:
# 1. Deploy to Vercel
# 2. Go to Storage tab in Vercel dashboard
# 3. Create a KV database
# 4. Vercel automatically injects the required environment variables
# 5. Done! No manual configuration needed

# Note: For local development with Vercel KV, you can pull the env vars:
# vercel env pull .env.local
